# Handwritten Digits Classification Using CNN and Transfer Learning

## Overview

This project involves training a model to classify handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transfer Learning techniques. It includes creating a web interface for image submission and prediction using Flask.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries:**
   Make sure to install all the necessary dependencies. You can find the list of required libraries in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
3. **Run the code:**
  Open the `train.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to train the model (CNN, DenseNet201).
  To start the web server, run the Flask app:
  ```sh
  python app.py
  ```
